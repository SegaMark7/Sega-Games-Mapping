 0x00f522|   1|Counter for the jingle easter egg. Starts at 00, goes up by 1 for every spot collected (except arrows). Resets back to 00 after a few seconds (tied to countdown on 0x00f525
 0x00f525|   1|Jingle countdown (see 0x00f522) Starts at $fe and counts down to 00.
 0x00f579|   1|Tied to a countdown timer of some sort. Confirmed to be used at least for Bonus Stage 1, after collecting all collectibles; game will lock the player from controlling Spot and this seems to be counting down until the next screen. It's normally just 00, but when last point is collected it counts down from b3 and back to 00 again, where the level fades out and transitions. Needs more research.
 0x00f5a7|   1|This is similar to 00xf579. It's 00 before changing to 03 the moment Spot collects the final point in a bonus stage, and then goes back to 00 when the level ends. Needs more research.
